### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm Landry from Eranove Academy. Eranove Academy is a school that offers a wide range of services and training in several fields, including digital, where I'm currently studying. At Eranove Academy, our values are excellence, sharing and community.
I'm interested in code but I'm not a developer.
I'm currently learning a lot about development and, in particular, how to learn it.
I'm looking to collaborate on various projects with different methods all over the world.
To contact me, here is my e-mail address louelandry@gmail.com
I'm at Eranove Academy, a school of excellence, to train me well in the digital professions so that I can be a complete workforce on the job market.
I am a student and I use this platform to learn and develop my educational projects.
